# Bikesharing

# Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create multiple clear and easy to understand visualizatioins for Citi Bike rides. 

# Process
- [x] downloaded data from website
- [x] uploaded data to Tableau
- [x] used Tableau to create basic graphs/charts to display total riders, genders, subscribers vs customers, & time of the day relation
- [x] Modified the date/time format of the trip duration using Jupyter Notebook to capture more accurate time of day analysis
- [x] re-uploaded clean data 
- [x] created 5 more visualizations 
- [x] added most relevant to my Tableau dashboard to allow clear conclusions of data

# Start by combining the total number of trips

# The majority of bike trips only last about 5 minutes. (146,752 bikes )

# The graph compares the number of minutes of gender to  the rider. Concluding over 3 times as many males have trip durations of 6 minutes than compared to females.

# This heat map visually demonstrates that the popular riding times throughout the week days are 8am and 5-6pm

## This heat map separates those ride times by gender. Males and females prefer to ride in the evening times than compared to the rest of the day. There are significantly more males that ride bikes in general but on the most active day of the week (Thursday at 7pm for both genders) show 3 times as many males than females riding.

# This shows the huge difference between customers and subscribers.

## This graph makes it easier to visualize that Thursdays are the more popular bike riding days for both genders with Friday not to far behind. More importantly with this visual - it shows the huge difference between levels of activity of customers and subscribers.



# Summary

I absolutely loved Tableau, very user friendly but most importantly, easy for the audience to be able to see what the data we collected actually means. 

Given the large number and distribution of Citi Bike Rides we were able to determine: significantly more males ride bikes, the most popular day and time of is Thursdays at 7pm, and that subscribers have significantly more activity than those just purchasing. 

Given the minimal trip duration (6 minutes) and the popular times of the day - this data allows me to conclude that most of these rides are for transportation purposes to and from work, school, etc versus riding a bike for workout/physical health purposes.
